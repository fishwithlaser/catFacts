            While a cat owner might automatically assume that their cat is simply behaving poorly when it pees outside the litter box, it may be doing so because of bladder complications. Issues with bladder health like infections and inflammation can cause a cat significant pain when urinating. This can lead to the cat associating the litter box with pain, which will cause them to avoid it.
